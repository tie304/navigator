# Navigator
Speed Dial for your Terminal.

Navigator is a simple wrapper over the terminal making navigation more efficent. This is a project that I decided to build after becoming fed up with the slow navigation system of the terminal.
I've increased my navigation time by roughly 100% and can get more work done.

## Features

* Faster navigation around the file system

  Simply type the number of the directory you want to navigate into or the number of the file you want to execute.
